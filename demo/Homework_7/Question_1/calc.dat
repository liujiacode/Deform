# Question 1.
# 
# A glass/epoxy laminate with a lay up sequence of  having the dimensions of
# L=100mm, w=25mm is subjected to aload of 10kN in the x direction. Determine
# the distribution across the thickness of the fowllow:
# On-axis strains
# On-axis stresses
# h=0.15mm
# 

# 
# Global definitions.
# 
system = stacking

# 
# Define thickness of each layer instead of write the z ticks of every layer.
