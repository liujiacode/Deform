# A glass/epoxy laminate with a lay up sequence of   having the dimensions of
# L=100mm, w=25mm is subjected to a bending moment per unit length about the
# y axis of Mx=20 N-m/m. Determine the distribution across the thickness of
# the following:
# ( h=0.15mm)
# On-axis stresses
# On-axis strains
# 

# 
# Global definitions.

# x_normal_load is corresponding to the load along 1 direction in bulk and laminate with theta = 0;
