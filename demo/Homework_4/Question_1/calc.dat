# Question 1.
# 
# A laminate of graphite/epoxy has the dimensions of 100 mm×25mm×4mm.
# It is subjected to a load of 10kN along the 2 direction, constrained in
# the 1 direction and absorbed 3% moisture. Determine the final dimensions
# of the plate, using plane-stress calculations.
# 

system = laminate

length    = 100E-3  # m
width     = 25E-3   # m
thickness = 4E-3    # m

delta_moi = 3 # %M

constrain_x = True

# 
# constrain_y would set y_normal_load to unknown and set y_normal_strain to zero
# automatically regardless of the fllowing setting of y_normal_load.
#
x_normal_load = 0    # N
y_normal_load = 10E3 # N
z_normal_load = 0    # N

yz_shear_load = 0  # N
xz_shear_load = 0  # N
xy_shear_load = 0  # N
