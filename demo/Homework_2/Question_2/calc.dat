# Question 2.
# 
# The same laminate as above is subjected to the same loading but with its faces
# constrained in the z direction, i.e.,  =0. Determine the new dimensions of the
# laminate.

# constrain_z would set z_normal_load to unknown and set z_normal_strain to zero
# automatically regardless of the fllowing setting of z_normal_load.
