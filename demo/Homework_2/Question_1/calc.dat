# Question 1.
# 
# A unidirectional laminate of glass/epoxy has the dimensions of 100 mm×25mm×4mm.
# It is subjected to a load of 100N along the 2 direction. Determine the new
# dimensions of plate, using the properties given in Table 1.
#

#
# bulk system is also fit for laminate calculations.
#
system = bulk

length    = 100E-3  # m
width     = 25E-3   # m
thickness = 4E-3    # m
