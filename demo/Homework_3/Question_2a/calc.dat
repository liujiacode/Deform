# Question 2a.
# 
# A unidirectional laminate of glass/epoxy has the dimensions of 100mm×25mm×4mm.
# It is subjected to a load of 10kN along the 1 direction and is constrained along
# the 2 direction.
# a) Determine the stresses and final configuration of the laminate.
# b) The laminate is left in moist air for the some time until it has absorbs 3%
# moisture. Determine the stresses and final configuration of the laminate. Compare
# with the results in the question(2a).
