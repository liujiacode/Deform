# Question 1.
# 
# A unidirectional laminate of glass/epoxy has the dimensions of 100 mm×25mm×4mm.
# It absorb 3% moisture. The laminate is constrained along the 1 direction. Determine
# the stress and final dimensions of the laminate.

width     = 25E-3   # m

constrain_x = True

# 
# constrain_x would set x_normal_load to unknown and set x_normal_strain to zero
# automatically regardless of the fllowing setting of x_normal_load.
# See output.dat line 62 and 73.
