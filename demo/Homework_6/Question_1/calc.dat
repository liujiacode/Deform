# 
# A glass/epoxy laminate with fibers oriented at 30  with the x axis
# has the dimensions of L=100mm, w=25mm and 4mm. It is constrained in
# the y direction by frictionless rollers and is subjected to the
# following loads:
# A load along the x direction of 10 kN
# A temperature increase of  
# Moisture absorption of  %
# Find the stresses in the plate and its final configuration
#
