# A laminate of graphite/epoxy composite(Vf = 60%) is oriented at 45 with respect
# to the axis. Find the following engineering properties:
# Ex, Ey,  , , Gxy
# Check to see if reciprocity relation holds.
# 

#
# E_x, E_y and other properties are contained in the transformed reduced S_matrix.
# See output.dat line 46.
