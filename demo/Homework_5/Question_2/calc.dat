# A laminate of graphite/epoxy laminate ( Vf  = 60%) has fibers oriented at
# angle of 30 with respect to x axis. It has the dimensions of L=100mm, w=25mm
# and t=4mm. It is subjected to the following loading condition:
# Uniaxial extension in the x direction of 0.05mm,
# Constrained in the y direction
# Has a reduction in the angle at lower left hand corner of 0.06
# Find the stress in the plate and also its final thickness (Assume plane stress condition)
# 

system = laminate

length    = 100E-3  # m
width     = 25E-3   # m
thickness = 4E-3    # m
